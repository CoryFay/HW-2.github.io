# HW-2.github.io

## Introduction
  This repo contains the [webpage](https://coryfay.github.io/HW-2.github.io/) where I will be updating my portfolio!
  
## About 

  The purpose of this project was to create a base level website containing information about myself. Within, are three different pages that provide a short bio, a portfolio page, and contact information. I Established this as a foundation on which i will continue to build and improve upon. I will be able to update my portfolio following some of my future projects.
  
## Troubles I faced

  This project required a reponsive layout that would operate and appear aesthetic using multiple different viewports.
