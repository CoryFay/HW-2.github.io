## About 

  The purpose of this project was to create a base level website containing information about myself. Within, are three different pages that provide a short bio, a portfolio page, and contact information. I Established this as a foundation on which i will continue to build and improve upon. I will be able to update my portfolio following some of my future projects.
  
## Troubles I faced

  This project required a reponsive layout that would operate and appear aesthetic using multiple different viewports.
